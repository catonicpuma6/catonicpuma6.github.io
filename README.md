Lehigh JOUR-025 Data Journalism Repository

I am [Luke Kaiser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lgk226/), a marketing and journalism student at Lehigh University. I am the Deputy Sports Editor for the University's newspaper: [The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/author/lgk226/). You've probably seen me advertising for the Bay Deli at home as a walking billboard or killing it on the dancefloor at orientation.

## JOUR-025 Data Story Project
My latest project is creating a data-driven story about the impact of allergy season on students at Lehigh due to the Lehigh Valley's reputation as "The Allergy Capital of the US."
