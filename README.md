# 2000 NBA Draft Infographic: Data courtesy of [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2000.html)
![Infographic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0979a3f2-53e6-42d0-a2d3-ecd85b64aa06)
For my infographic assignment, I chose to analyze the 2000 NBA Draft. While often considered to be the worst draft class in history, I set out to find out if that was really true. My question I set out to answer was: Is the 2000 NBA Draft class really as bad as experts say? The answer: a RESOUNDING yes. 
The first part of the infographic that answers this question is the class overview. 58 players were drafted in 2000, and only 50 players actually appeared in a game. That means that 8 players who were drafted never even appeared in a game or secured a spot on an active roster, showcasing that the talent already wasn't high. In addition, 43% of the draftees had careers shorter than 4.5 years. Basketball Reference calculates the average NBA career to be approximately 4.5 years long, and 43% of the 58 players who were drafted couldn't stay in the league for at least 5 years. This is because their talent level and game didn't translate to the NBA level, hence proving this draft class to be effectively poor. In addition, this class produced only three all-star caliber players, tied for the second lowest amount in history and produced zero hall of famers. In the NBA's history, when taking hall of fame "locks" in future drafts into consideration, the 2000 NBA Draft is the only draft that has zero hall of fame players. Drafts in the future all produced hall of fame level talent, except the 2000 NBA Draft. Even the 1958 draft, the draft that produced the fewest amount of all-stars produced a hall of fame player in Elgin Baylor. This draft by that metric possessed the worst pool of talent in NBA history. However, it goes beyond that. 

As seen in the right hand side of the infographic, I have constructed two scatterplots using data from the draft class' career statistics. The top plot shows the amount of winshares achieved by each draftee. A winshare is an estimation of the total amount of wins an individual players' performances contribute to. The higher the winshare total, the better. The 2000 NBA Draft's highest winshare total by a player is 63.3 winshares, achieved by Hedo Turkoglu. Turkoglu was never an all-star and came off the bench in most of his seasons. That 63.3 winshares doesn't even place him in the top-300 players of all time. To put that into further perspective, Nikola Jokic, a player who has only played 9 seasons compared to Turkoglu's 15, nearly doubles his total winshares with 111.58. The fact that players who played significantly less seasons nearly double the winshare total from the most valuable player in the class proves that the talent is poor. The players in this class simply were not as effective and valuable to a team's performance as other years, and the winshare scatterplot shows that. In addition, 28 players who played a game in the NBA from this class recorded winshare totals below double-digits, proving how ineffective they were on the court. 

On the bottom chart, we can see the total box plus minus of each draftee. Box plus minus is a metric that compares a player's contributions to the average NBA player on a numerical scale. A BPM of 0 signifies the average NBA player, and any number above means a player is that amount better than average. Any number below zero means the player is that amount worse than average. Hilariously, 45 of the 50 players in this draft class who recorded minutes have a career BPM in the NEGATIVES. That means that 90% of the players who played in games performed as below-average NBA players. When compared to the 58 drafted players, 78% of the class was considered below average for their entire careers. The remaining 5 players don't fare any better. Michael Redd leads this class in career BPM at 2.2, meaning he was 2.2 points above average for his entire career. He is the only player in this class a point more valuable to a team. Both of these splits are historic numbers for this class, proving how awful it truly is. If you're producing "NBA talent" that contains 90% below-average players who are being selected, you definitely deserve the title as the worst draft class in NBA history.

## Pittsburgh Steelers Brief Overview/Timeline
This is a timeline about the history of the Pittsburgh Steelers. The events on the timeline represent big moments in the team's history, such as the formation, key draft picks, and seasons that ended in a championship. This timeline truly exemplifies how the team was built from the ground up and found success after tumultuous starts and they have sustained that success ever since the team's first ring in 1974. It is truly amazing to see how since the 1969 season, the Steelers have only had three head coaches at the helm, showcasing the incredible leadership and talent the organization has been dealt. The data for these stories was gathered from [Football-Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/pit/index.htm) and the [Pro Football Hall of Fame](https://www.profootballhof.com/teams/pittsburgh-steelers/)!

This bar graph shows the top 10 total receiving yards leaders by rookies through Week 6 in the 2024 NFL season. This data was collected from [Statmuse](https://www.statmuse.com/nfl/ask/nfl-rookie-receiving-yards-leaders-2024), [Football-Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2024/receiving.htm) and the [NFL](https://www.nfl.com/stats/player-stats/category/receiving/2024/REG/all/receivingyards/DESC). This data includes all rookie positions, including tight ends and wide receivers from many different teams. The rookies include Brian Thomas Jr, Malik Nabers, Brock Bowers, Marvin Harrison Jr, Rome Odunze, Jordan Whittington, Xavier Worthy, Ladd McConkey, Keon Coleman and Xavier Legette. One interesting stat that stands out is the fact that Nabers, the star rookie receiver from the New York Giants, is second on this list despite missing a game with a concussion. 

## MLB Fastest Average Fastball Velocity By Year Line Chart
![Highest_Average_Fastball_MLB_Pitching_Leaders_By_Year_Starters_Relievers_chartbuilder](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e79f40b8-94b4-48b0-923a-e774e1d9ccf0)
This line chart shows the fastest average fastball velocity by both starting and relief pitchers since 2017. The reason for 2017 being the starting point is because 2017 marks the earliest year baseball analytics website baseballsavant began tracking data like fastball velocity across all qualified pitchers. The data for this chart was collected from [baseballsavant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/leaderboard/pitch-arsenals?year=2024&min=250&type=avg_speed&hand=). As the chart shows, relievers often boast a higher average fastball velocity than starting pitchers. This is likely because relievers can afford to throw as hard as they possibly can, due to their pitch limits often being much lower than a starting pitcher. Relievers only throw about one inning, compared to a starter's 5+, so they can throw a volume of high-speed fastballs without worrying too much about wear and tear on their arm over multiple innings. It is interesting that startin pitchers actually went above relievers in 2020, but this is likely due to the shortened season, so relievers weren't appearing in as many games as previous years.
